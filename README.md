This project is made for Satakunta University of Applied sciences class Let's Make a Game!

## Starting the Development Build

Unity version 2022.3.8f1 has been used to develop the game.

All models are created using Blender and utilize the .blend method, thus it is required to install Blender version 2.60+ to run the project in Unity. [Read more from here](https://docs.unity3d.com/560/Documentation/Manual/HOWTO-ImportObjectBlender.html).

The main scene is ``Game``.
